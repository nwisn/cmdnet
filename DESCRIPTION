Description: This package computes correlation matrix distance (CMD) statistics
    for an ensemble of networks. It can be used to quantify overal and node-specific
    differences between network datasets, and rank nodes by consistency of edge
    weights.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.2.3),
    psych,
    matrixcalc
